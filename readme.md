# Basic Machine Learning Wind Turbine Project
This is where school where we used different machine learning models to determine which one accurately predicts wind turbine power generation.

The methodology will include machine learning techniques that balance optimality with high efficiency and accuracy. These techniques will help us identify the best model to fit our data and predict classes.

1. Linear Regression / Polynomial Regression / KNN Classification / SVM Modelling (to help predict the total project capacity optimally)
2. LDA (for factor reduction)
3. KNN / Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes / Multinomial Classifications (to maximize our accuracy with classification modelling)
4. Decision Tree Analysis (alternative approaches to modeling our dataset for alternative optimality levels)
5. Neural Network Class-label Classification
